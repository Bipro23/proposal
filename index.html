                The day I started having feelings for you❣, I planned to propose to you in the best way ever😬❣.
                However, sometimes what we think doesn't happen😅.
                I searched for ideas for many days and found a special one, but I won't share it with you.😛
                Instead, I want your future partner to propose in a better way.
                Here are some leftover ideas from my search; I've saved them for him.😗
                He should propose in a meaningful way, or else I will kill him.🔪
                I hope that girl experiences the special magical relatonship that I wanted to give her.🌍❤
